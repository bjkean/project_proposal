##Additional Wrangling
Even though the data had gone through one round of cleaing, the data was not as clean as I initially thought. There were some data points that were not identified as being invalid. These had to be corrected in order to produce valid results. 

####Invalid Airport Codes
The first item needed to be addressed was the invalid airport codes. About 1.5% of the data had airport codes that were not listed in the airport file. Instead of valid 3-byte airport codes, there were a string of numbers. These were eliminated by applying a semi join. Those numeric airport codes that were not in the airport table were eliminated.


####Null Values
The second piece of wrangling that need to be applied was the elimination of null values from the Arrival Time and/or Departure Time. Since the focus of my project is to look at the factors affecting, specifically, the time the flight is scheduled, I chose to eliminate these values.

####Time
Format went from AAAA to HH:MM

##Features added
####Arrival/Departure Delay
The first feature I added to my data set was column with 0 to indicate no delay and 1 to indicate delay. This was helpful in identifying and filtering flights with delays. 

####Hour of Departure
The next feature I added was the hour of departure. To get this, I grabbed the first two characters from the Departure Time column (format == HH:MM). Prior to extracting the hour of depature, I was having issues with plotting a time series graph. However, extracting the hour solved this and led to some interesting results.

##Application of Statistics 
####Summary Statistics
Below are summary statistics of the data when a delay occured. If a delay did not occur on a flight, then it was not included in the summary below. Below the summary statistics is a histogram showing  the distribution of the delay times. Clearly, I am dealing with a left-skewed data distribution.

<br>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
<br>   1.00    6.00   15.00   33.12   39.00 1636.00 
<br>

####Probability of having a delay
The first data point I wanted to look at was percentage of flights that are late (delayed) upon arrival. Initially, I thought this would be 10-15%. However, according the data that I looked at, around 37.4% of flights are delayed - over 150% higher than I expected! A slightly higher number of flights were delayed for Departure. Departing flights were delayed around 39% of the time for the sample I looked at.

At a rate of 37.4%, a person would have the following expected chances of having a delay:<br>
P(delay given n number of flights) = 1-(1-0.374)^5
1 flights - 37.4%<br>
2 flights - 60.8%<br>
3 flights - 75.5%<br>
4 flights - 84.6%<br>
5 flights - 90.4%<br>

####Probability of delay given an event
The next data point I looked at was determining the probability of an arrival delay given that a departure delay occured.<br>
P(arrival delay|departure delay)<br>
The results were not suprising. When there was a delay on the departure end of flight, there was likely a delay on the arrival side. The probability of a delay on arrival give there was a delay on departure was observed was 71.1%. Where there was not a delay on departure, you were only expected to be delayed 16.3% of the time. This expected outcome seemed obvious, but I wanted to review it because it might be a good indicator to use in a regression model.

####Probability of delay given hour of departure
This statistic is the one of the main themes of my analysis. I expected that the results for the morning would show a lower probability of delay. My expectations generally follow what was expeted. The results show that early morning hours, that is 4 or 5 AM, show a lower expected probablity of delay (~25%) than later in the day and those hours after midnight (+40%). Due to the difference in time vs. how humans, and subsequently airlines, structure their day, I plan to create some extra elements for future analysis (morning, midday, evening, overnight). I believe this makes more sense and this is how major travel sellers present their products. Additionally, flights after midnight made up less than 1% of the data so it may make sense to eliminate them.

####Size of Airport
I wanted to see if the size of airport was correlated to the probablility of a delay. I expected busier airports would have more delays. However, initial results do not support this idea. It seems that regardless of size, most of the larger airports seems to hover in the 37% range according to the graph.

##Limitations
Each flight was an idenpendent event. No way of know if a delayed flight impacted additional flights.
