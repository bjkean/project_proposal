#### **problem**
Most of us have been there before. We are on the way to the airport for a vacation, business trip or a long weekend out of town and *it* happens. A text appears on your phone. It is from a strangely formatted number and obviously written by a bot. Upon realizing this you know all too well what has happened: **your flight has just been delayed.** This is NOT the way you wanted to start your trip. 

*Is it possible that this could have been avoided?* I believe that there is and I want to explore if there is a way to predict which flights, in terms of departure time and/or city should be avoided to reduce the likelihood of a flight delay. 
<hr>
#### **client**
These days, flight delays seem to be unavoidable. Flight delays cost business travelers millions of dollars each year in added travel costs, lost revenue and missed opportunities. **If there was a way for business travelers could predict which flights to avoid, they could save themselves time, money and stress.** They could select higher performing flights and better connection cities.

#### **data**
The data used for this project is from the Kaggle website. It was sourced from the Department of Transportation and contains one year of data (2015).

##Wrangling
Overall, the date was quite clean and did not require structural wrangling. The data was already in a tidy format - each row was a seperate instance and there were no aggregated columns. However, the data did have several issues that required attention such as invalid values, nulls, etc. Also, to complete the analysis, I was required to add some features to make the data more usable.
<hr>
####Invalid Airport Codes
About 1.5% of the data had airport codes that were not listed in the airport file. Instead of valid 3-byte airport codes, there was a string of numbers populated in either the origin airport, the departure airport, or both. These were eliminated by applying a semi join. Those numeric airport codes that were not in the airport table were eliminated.
<br> **flight_data <- semi_join(flight_data, airport)**


####Null Values
The second piece of wrangling that need to be applied was the elimination of null values from the Arrival Time and/or Departure Time. Since the focus of my project is to look at the factors specifically  affecting the time a flight is scheduled, I chose to eliminate these values. 

####Time
Format went from AAAA to HH:MM

##Features added
####Arrival/Departure Delay
The first feature I added to my data set was column with 0 to indicate no delay and 1 to indicate delay. This was helpful in identifying and filtering flights with delays. 

####Hour of Departure
The next feature I added was the hour of departure. To get this, I grabbed the first two characters from the Departure Time column (format == HH:MM). Prior to extracting the hour of depature, I was having issues with plotting a time series graph. However, extracting the hour solved this and led to some interesting results.


##Approach
For this study, I will be focusing on which time of day the delay occurred and at which airport/region the delay occurred. I think it will be necessary to consider these two variables together due to environmental issues that affect specific airports (e.g. afternoon thunderstorms in Miami). Time of year will also likely need to be considered to account for weather that only occurs during certain times of the year. In addition to the apparent challenges that weather can pose, I want to see if avoiding certain flight times can improve one's chance of avoiding a flight delay, despite the time of year. After I have completed my modeling for one year of data, I am hoping that delays will be predicted in the second year of data. To predict the probability of flight delays, I will use logistic regression as my model. To predict which factors are significant in predicting delays, I will use linear regression as my model.



##Application of Statistics
####Summary Statistics
Below are summary statistics of the data when a delay occured. If a delay did not occur on a flight, then it was not included in the summary below. Below the summary statistics is a histogram showing  the distribution of the delay times. Clearly, I am dealing with a left-skewed data distribution.
<br>
<br>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
<br>   1.00    6.00   15.00   33.12   39.00 1636.00 
<br>

####Probability of having a delay
The first data point I wanted to look at was percentage of flights that are late (delayed) upon arrival. Initially, I thought this would be 10-15%. However, according the data that I looked at, around 37.4% of flights are delayed - over 150% higher than I expected! A slightly higher number of flights were delayed for Departure. Departing flights were delayed around 39% of the time for the sample I looked at.

At a rate of 37.4%, a person would have the following expected chances of having a delay:<br>
P(delay given n number of flights) = 1-(1-0.374)^5
1 flights - 37.4%<br>
2 flights - 60.8%<br>
3 flights - 75.5%<br>
4 flights - 84.6%<br>
5 flights - 90.4%<br>

<br>

####Probability of delay given an event
The next data point I looked at was determining the probability of an arrival delay given that a departure delay occured.<br>
P(arrival delay|departure delay)<br>
The results were not suprising. When there was a delay on the departure end of flight, there was likely a delay on the arrival side. The probability of a delay on arrival give there was a delay on departure was observed was 71.1%. Where there was not a delay on departure, you were only expected to be delayed 16.3% of the time. This expected outcome seemed obvious, but I wanted to review it because it might be a good indicator to use in a regression model.

<br>

####Probability of delay given hour of departure
This statistic is the one of the main themes of my analysis. I expected that the results for the morning would show a lower probability of delay. My expectations generally follow what was expeted. The results show that early morning hours, that is 4 or 5 AM, show a lower expected probablity of delay (~25%) than later in the day and those hours after midnight (+40%). Due to the difference in time vs. how humans, and subsequently airlines, structure their day, I plan to create some extra elements for future analysis (morning, midday, evening, overnight). I believe this makes more sense and this is how major travel sellers present their products. Additionally, flights after midnight made up less than 1% of the data so it may make sense to eliminate them.

####Size of Airport
I wanted to see if the size of airport was correlated to the probablility of a delay. I expected busier airports would have more delays. However, initial results do not support this idea. It seems that regardless of size, most of the larger airports seems to hover in the 37% range according to the graph.

##Limitations
Each flight was an idependent event. There is no way of knowing if a delayed flight impacted additional flights. That is, there is no way to tell if a flight was part of a larger itinerary. This information would be useful since there is no way of knowing if a delay of 30 minutes was impactful to a larger itinerary or just an inconvenience.
